          <h4 class="intro-desc">Infringement</h4>
          <p class="intro-desc">Do not post content that infringes the rights of third parties.

          <p>Reporting an infringement:</p>
          <p>In order to notify us of an infringement, email hello@pryvit.ie.com.</p>

          <h4 class="intro-desc">Liability</h4>
          <p class="intro-desc">Nothing in these terms shall limit our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, or for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or the negligence of our agents or employees. You agree not to hold us responsible for things other users post or do.</p>
          <p class="intro-desc">We do not review users' postings and are not involved in the actual transactions between users. As the content on pryvit.ie comes from other users, we do not guarantee the accuracy of postings or user communications or the quality, safety, or legality of what's offered. Companies offering welcome offers are responsible for all legal aspects associated with their posts. </p>
          <p class="intro-desc">You are solely responsible for the contents of your posts (including description, price, fees, tax that you calculate, any required legal disclosures, and any offers or promotional content) and agree that such your content will be true, accurate and complete.</p>
          <p class="intro-desc">In no event do we accept liability of any description for the posting of any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene or indecent information, or material of any kind which violates or infringes upon the rights of any other person, including without limitation any transmissions constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable law.</p>
          <p class="intro-desc">You acknowledge that we cannot guarantee continuous, error-free or secure access to our services or that defects in the service will be corrected. While we will use reasonable efforts to maintain an uninterrupted service, we cannot guarantee this and we do not give any promises or warranties (whether express or implied) about the operation and availability of our sites, services, applications or tools.</p>

We are not liable for any loss, whether of money (including profit), goodwill, or reputation, or any special, indirect, or consequential damages arising out of your use of, or inability to use pryvit.ie, even if you advise us or we could reasonably foresee the possibility of any such damage occurring. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you. Despite the previous paragraph, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or any third party (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, by statute or otherwise) is limited to the greater of (a) the total fees you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability, and (b) 100 Pounds Sterling.</p>
